# Project Background
Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. In this project, I analyze properties for people who want an instant, one-click service to  buy properties in the San Francisco real-estate market. 


## Technologies
The project uses python 3.7 as a programming language and Jupyter Lab notebook. 

## Usage

The main task in this Challenge is to visualize and analyze the real-estate data in  Jupyter notebook. I use the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook to complete the following tasks:

**Calculate and plot the housing units per year**
